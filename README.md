# SafeCode Encryption Script

SafeCode is a Python-based encryption tool that helps protect your Python scripts by encrypting them. It ensures that the script is only encrypted under certain conditions verified via Firebase, adding an extra layer of security.

## Prerequisites

Before running the script, ensure you have the following installed:

- Python 3.x
- `requests` library (for making HTTP requests)

You can install the `requests` library using the following command:

```bash
pip install requests
```

## Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the SafeCode repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitDas4321/SafeCode.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd SafeCode && python3 setup.py install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the `safeCode.py` script to encrypt your Python files.

### 1. Running the Script

To start the script, simply run:

```bash
python3 safeCode.py
```

### 2. How to Use the Script

- The script will guide you with commands in a restricted shell.
  - Type `ls` to list the files in the current directory.
  - Type `cd <directory>` to change directories.
  - Type the name of the Python script you want to encrypt (e.g., `script.py`).
  - The script will be encrypted and saved as `encrypted_<script_name>.py` in the default directory (usually your Desktop).

### 3. Encryption Process

The encryption works by:
- Reading the Python script file you specify.
- Compiling the script to bytecode.
- Serializing the bytecode using `marshal`.
- Compressing the serialized bytecode with `zlib`.
- Encoding the compressed bytecode with `base64`.

The encrypted script is saved in the format `encrypted_<script_name>.py`.

### 4. Example

For example, if you want to encrypt a Python script called `example.py`, you will:
- Run the script with `python3 safeCode.py`
- Select `example.py` when prompted.
- The encrypted script will be saved as `encrypted_example.py` on your Desktop.

## Firebase Integration

The script fetches a status from a Firebase Realtime Database to determine whether encryption can proceed. You can configure your Firebase URL in the script (`firebase_url = 'your_firebase_url'`).

## Features

- **Secure Encryption:** Ensures that only valid requests will trigger encryption.
- **Interactive Shell:** Provides an interactive shell where users can manage directories and files.
- **Base64, zlib, and marshal:** Uses these techniques for encryption, ensuring a secure and compact output.
