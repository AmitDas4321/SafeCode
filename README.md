# SafeCode Encryption Script 🔒

## What is SafeCode? 🤔

**SafeCode** is a Python-based encryption tool designed to securely encrypt your Python scripts. It ensures that your code remains safe from unauthorized access, protecting your intellectual property by converting scripts into an unreadable format. The encryption process involves compiling the script to bytecode, serializing it, then compressing and encoding the bytecode. This makes it extremely difficult for anyone to reverse-engineer your code. 🔐

## Why Use SafeCode? 🚀

SafeCode is essential for developers who want to protect their Python code, especially when sharing or distributing it. Here's why you should use SafeCode:

- **Protect Intellectual Property**: Safeguard your Python code from unauthorized duplication or tampering. 🛡️
- **Prevent Unauthorized Access**: Encrypt your script to ensure only authorized users can access and run it. 🔑
- **Easy to Use**: The encryption process is simple and integrates seamlessly into your workflow, offering a user-friendly command-line interface. ⚙️

## Setup Instructions 🛠️

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the environment.

### 1. Clone the Repository 📥

Start by cloning the **SafeCode** repository to your local machine:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitDas4321/SafeCode.git
```

### 2. Install Dependencies 📦

Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required dependencies using the following command:

```bash
cd SafeCode && python3 setup.py install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies for SafeCode to function properly. 🖥️

## Usage 💻

Once the installation is complete, you can use the `safeCode.py` script to encrypt your Python files. Follow these simple steps:

### 1. Running the Script ▶️

To start the script, open a terminal and run:

```bash
python3 safeCode.py
```

### 2. How to Use the Script 📝

The script will guide you through the process using an interactive shell. Here’s how to use it:

- Type `ls` to list all files in the current directory. 📂
- Use `cd <directory>` to change to a specific directory. 🔄
- Type the name of the Python script you want to encrypt (e.g., `script.py`). 📝
- The script will encrypt the file and save it as `encrypted_<script_name>.py` in the default directory (usually your Desktop). 💾

### 3. The Encryption Process 🔐

The encryption process works as follows:

- **Step 1**: The script reads the Python file you specify. 📖
- **Step 2**: It compiles the script into bytecode. 🔄
- **Step 3**: The bytecode is serialized using `marshal`. 🗂️
- **Step 4**: The serialized bytecode is compressed using `zlib`. 🧳
- **Step 5**: The compressed bytecode is then encoded in **Base64**. 📡

The result is a secure, encrypted Python script saved as `encrypted_<script_name>.py`. 🔒

### 4. Example 📄

If you want to encrypt a Python script called `example.py`, follow these steps:

1. Run the command: `python3 safeCode.py` ▶️
2. Select `example.py` when prompted. 🖱️
3. The encrypted file will be saved as `encrypted_example.py` on your Desktop. 💻

## Features ⚙️

- **Secure Encryption**: Ensures that only valid requests will trigger encryption. 🔐
- **Interactive Shell**: Provides an interactive shell to manage directories and files. 📂
- **Base64, zlib, and marshal**: Utilizes these techniques to encrypt your code, ensuring both security and a compact output. 📦
