## Installation

Follow these steps to clone the repository and set up the environment:

### 1. Clone the repository

Clone the SafeCode repository to your local machine using:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/AmitDas4321/SafeCode.git
```

### 2. Install dependencies

Navigate into the cloned repository and install the required dependencies:

```bash
cd SafeCode && python3 setup.py install
```

This will install all the necessary dependencies.

## Usage

Once the installation is complete, you can use the `safeCode.py` script to encrypt your Python files.

### 1. Running the Script

To start the script, simply run:

```bash
python3 safeCode.py
```

### 2. How to Use the Script

- The script will guide you with commands in a restricted shell.
  - Type `ls` to list the files in the current directory.
  - Type `cd <directory>` to change directories.
  - Type the name of the Python script you want to encrypt (e.g., `script.py`).
  - The script will be encrypted and saved as `encrypted_<script_name>.py` in the default directory (usually your Desktop).

### 3. Encryption Process

The encryption works by:
- Reading the Python script file you specify.
- Compiling the script to bytecode.
- Serializing the bytecode using `marshal`.
- Compressing the serialized bytecode with `zlib`.
- Encoding the compressed bytecode with `base64`.

The encrypted script is saved in the format `encrypted_<script_name>.py`.

### 4. Example

For example, if you want to encrypt a Python script called `example.py`, you will:
- Run the script with `python3 safeCode.py`
- Select `example.py` when prompted.
- The encrypted script will be saved as `encrypted_example.py` on your Desktop.

## Features

- **Secure Encryption:** Ensures that only valid requests will trigger encryption.
- **Interactive Shell:** Provides an interactive shell where users can manage directories and files.
- **Base64, zlib, and marshal:** Uses these techniques for encryption, ensuring a secure and compact output.
